## Demo

<img src="./src/images/recipe-sharing.gif" align="middle" alt="A live demo of using the recipe sharing application from getting to landing page, to viewing the recipes, adding a recipe, viewing your own recipes, and editting a recipe." width="575">

A demo using an account → recipes → add recipes → view account's recipes -> edit recipe -> delete recipe.

## Share recipes

You can view recipes added by other users, or add and view your own recipes with the [recipe sharing app][site]! Go to 'Add Recipe' to add a recipe with a name, information, ingredients, and instructions. Or go to 'My Recipes' to view your recipes. If you click on the name of your recipe, you'll be led to your recipe's page. You'll see a button to edit the recipe if you're the author. When you're on the editting page you can update or delete your recipe.

You'll need to create an account to add, edit, or delete a recipe and access a list of your recipes. With the demo account, you won't able to do these things, but you can see what it's like to have an account and view differences in features available.

You can view recipes by clicking 'Recipe Sharing' at the top, which is available to both visitors and users.
